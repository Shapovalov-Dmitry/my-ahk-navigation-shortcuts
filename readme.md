## Shortcuts and useful scripts written in AutoHotKey 

#### `shortcuts.ahk` - current state of shortcuts that I find useful for increase of productivity when using a regular qwerty keyboard. Main idea is to add a layer of actions activated by a `fn` key, similar to how it is done in mechanical keyboards configurations (like VIA/QMK). `CapsLock` is used as a `fn` key and doesn't act as a normal `CapsLock`.



#### `disable_touchpad_while_typing.ahk` - a script found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoHotkey/comments/74whf2/trying_to_disable_touchpad_while_typing_on_a_cube/), which disables touchpad input for a small time period after last letter character was typed. It is a substitute for "palm rejection" feature that used to be present on older IBM and Dell laptops.
